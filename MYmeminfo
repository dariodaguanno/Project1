//This program is part of the warmup which will use proc to display the free memory in the system
//and the number of memory buffers

    //fopen will open the file meminfo that is a part of proc

        exit(1);
    }

    c = fgetc(fp);//fgetc gets the next character in the file
    while(c != EOF){//This will run until EOF is empty
        printf("%c", c);
